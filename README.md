# Friday Night Funkin': Troll Engine

[Troll Engine](https://github.com/riconuts/troll-engine) is the fork of [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine) 0.5.2h originally made for the [Tails Gets Trolled mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/320596).

## NOTE:

This engine is a ****WORK IN PROGRESS****!!! 

Expect bugs, breaking changes and little documentation!!! (You can look at the `example_content` folder or the [wiki](https://github.com/riconuts/FNF-Troll-Engine/wiki) for some hints)

## Features:

 - Quant note skins
 - Lots of hud customization (NPS counter, note hit timing info, colored combos, judgement counters, options for other hud styles too)
 - An awesome modchart system
 - Custom hscript implementation (scriptable notetypes, events, stages, characters and song scripts)
 - Scriptable states
 - A lot more!!!

## Installation / Requirements:

* Must have Haxe 4.3.0 or greater.

* Troll Engine's specific haxe libraries can be installed with the `haxelibs` files located in the `setup` folder.

* If this is your first time compiling a HaxeFlixel project, refer to the full [build instructions](https://github.com/riconuts/FNF-Troll-Engine/blob/main/BUILDING.md).
